# Bicycle-Oriented District (BOD) Analysis

This project is an analysis which aims to discover where Bicycle-Oriented Districts (BOD's) could be viable.

The current analysis includes:
- Population density
- Affordable housing density
- Car-free / low-car households
- Highest ridership transit stops
- Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) [equity matrix](https://equity.bikeloudpdx.org) (includes income, race, languages spoken)

## TODO:
[x] Acquire 2017 ACS Population Density data
[ ] Acquire Trimet Ridership data
[ ] Acquire Aff. Housing Density data
[ ] Acquire Car-Free/Low-Car Households data (Table: )
[ ] Export Equity Matrix map
[ ] Develop cumulative ranking/scoring formula
